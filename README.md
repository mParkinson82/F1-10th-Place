# F1-10th-Place
A basic name generator based on Formula 1 motorsport series. The name picker will randomly choose from a series of 20 names, some more probable than others based on race result data for 2023, to find the driver most likely to finish in 10 place.

Note: The code was written with the assisstance of ChatGPT (as the creation of the page was beyond my current skillset) and may be messy, innacurate, inefficient, or deprecated.

Contributions for improvements are welcome, but honestly this is a learning exercise and a bit of fun.
